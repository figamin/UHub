      <p>Using UHub means you agree to the following rules</p>
      <ol id="globalRulesUl">
        <li>You must be at least 18 to use this site.</li>
        <li>You won't post:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>NSFW content (we want this to be a SFW website)</li>
        <li>Personal information about people (dox). Users have a right to privacy on this site.</li>
        <li>Anything that is illegal in the US (where this is hosted)</li>
        <li>Political discussion in general (this tends to ruin these kinds of sites)</li>
        <li>Slurs or other derogatory content. This place is meant to be comfy, not a hellscape.</li>
        <li>Ads to unrelated services</li>
        <li>Low quality threads (this should be obvious)</li>
      </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>Please try and keep this place comfy. We're trying to make a viable alternative to stuff like reddit and yikyak, not just some chan.</p>
